    "This week, we take text corpora that we have developed, spidered, scraped, and encoded, and we find and count words and simple phrases and properties of those counts (e.g., word frequency distributions). Initially, we model how to search corpora for keywords or phrases. Next, we examine the distributions of terms and phrases across a corpus, and the corelation between different words and phrase counts. Then we calculate word frequenceis, conditional frequences (the frequency of word *shock* conditional on the presence of word *awe*), and statistically significant collocations of length *n*. Then we distinguish *important* words and phrase within the corpus, and image them with Wordls! Next, we perform the Kullbach Leibler Divergence between the word frequence distributions from two corpora. Finally, we coarsely disambiguate words based of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and normalize them through stemming and lemmatization.\n",
