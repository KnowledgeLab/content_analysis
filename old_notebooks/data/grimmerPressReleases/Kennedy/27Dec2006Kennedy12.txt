August 9  1974   Vice President Gerald Rudolph Ford became the 38th President of the United States  Ford s elevation to the nation s highest political office followed a long  distinguished career in the U S  House of Representatives where he represented the Fifth District of Michigan for 25 years  and served as House Minority Leader for eight years  He served as Vice President of the United States following the forced resignation of Vice President Spiro T  Agnew who had pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of income tax evasion  He became President of the United States following President Richard Nixon s resignation during impeachment proceedings as a result of his involvement in the Watergate affair and other abuses of power and violations of the civil liberties of Americans  When Ford became president  his record of decency and integrity went far toward healing the wounds of Watergate   On Sept  8  1974   President Ford granted a full  free and absolute pardon to former President Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he     has committed or may have committed or taken part in while he was president  Nixon accepted the pardon  In his autobiography  Ford wrote of the pardon  I simply was not convinced that the country wanted to see an ex president behind bars  We are not a vengeful people  forgiveness is one of the roots of the American tradition  And Nixon  in my opinion  had already suffered enormously  His resignation was an implicit admission of guilt  and he would have to carry forever the burden of his disgrace  But I wasn t motivated primarily by sympathy for his plight or by concern over the state of his health  It was the state of the country s health at home and around the world that worried me   The response from the press  members of Congress  and the general public was overwhelmingly negative  The critics contended that the pardon was premature because it precluded possible indictment that might have led to answers to some of the remaining Watergate questions  Appearing before the U  S  House Committee on the Judiciary  President Ford explained under oath  in the only sworn congressional testimony ever given by a sitting president  that there were no deals connected with the pardon  He said he hoped his action would begin the process of healing the presidency and a deeply wounded nation  In November 1976  President Ford lost the White House to Jimmy Carter in one of the closest elections in American history  Many historians believe Ford s pardon of Nixon contributed to his defeat  Many have also come to believe that President Ford was the right man at the right time who played a leadership role in helping to restore the American people s trust in their government   The John F  Kennedy Library and Museum is the nation s official memorial to President John F  Kennedy  35th President of the United States  The Kennedy Library is a presidential library administered by the National Archives and Records Administration and supported  in part  by the Kennedy Library Foundation  a non profit organization  The Kennedy Library and the Kennedy Library Foundation seek to promote  through educational and community programs  a greater appreciation and understanding of American politics  history  and culture  the process of governing and the importance of public service    Laura Capps Melissa
