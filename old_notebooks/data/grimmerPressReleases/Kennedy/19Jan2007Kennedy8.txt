         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Mr  President  Id like to take a moment to join my colleague  the junior Senator from Massachusetts  to mark a significant and sad anniversary  Ten years ago today  America lost a great patriot  Massachusetts lost a great advocate  and John Kerry and I lost a great friend when Paul Tsongas passed away after a valiant and courageous fight with cancer Paul Tsongas was the epitome of a public servant  From his time in the Peace Corps in both Ethiopia and the West Indies in the 1960s through his spirited campaign for the Presidency in 1992  Paul lived by the words my brother Jack believed so strongly  that each of us can make a difference and all of us should try Paul Tsongas tried his best to do so  all his life  and he made a large and continuing difference  To the people of his beloved Lowell  he proved that our great industrial cities can be reborn and renewed  with a creative emphasis on reshaping their great history to meet the needs of our current high tech economy  In the 1970s and 1980s  when America was moving inexorably to the suburbs and so many of our great urban centers were being hollowed out  many of our people found it increasingly difficult to see a bright future for urban areas decimated by the decline of manufacturing  But today  across the country  a new movement has been born to encourage creative investment in our cities  and one of the first models for how such efforts can succeed is the vision Paul Tsongas had for Lowell  Massachusetts F  Scott Fitzgerald may have said there are no second acts in American life  but Paul Tsongas could have responded  Let him come to Lowell Paul served in the House  and joined me in the Senate in 1978  He was someone I knew I could always count on to fight hard for the people of Massachusetts  and the nation  He was tireless  determined  and always well prepared  Sometimes we would disagree on policy matters  here and there  but if you were going to challenge Paul  you had better have your facts straight  because he knew what he was talking about He also was an outstanding campaigner  The conventional wisdom in politics has always been  at least as long as I can remember  that candidates with difficult to pronounce names have a small additional hurdle Paul had a silent t at the beginning of his name  and Ill never forget how brilliantly he turned that small disadvantage into a major asset in his victorious campaigns for elective office  He ran hilarious ads that had all these people struggling to pronounce his name  and none of them could do it  But by the end of the campaign  every voter could do the silent t and everyone loved the candidate who made fun of himself on TV Its a lesson that Paul would carry on throughout his courageous battle against cancer  Everyone faces obstacles  some great and some small  Its how we choose to do to deal with them that makes us who we are Paul Tsongas was an inspiration to all who knew him  The son of a Greek immigrant father and a mother who died of tuberculosis  he demonstrated again and again that through hard work  commitment  and a passion for doing what is right  all things are possible in our America He charted a new course for the city he loved  He authored the Alaska Lands Act to protect millions of acres of American wilderness  and he founded  with our former colleague  Warren Rudman  the Concord Coalition  which has become a highly respected force for fiscal responsibility since its creation in the early 1990s  When the diagnosis of cancer was made  he left Senate to spend more time with his wonderful wife Niki  his loving sister Thaleia  and his three daughters  Ashley  Katina  and Molly After completing his rigorous treatment  he threw his hat in the Presidential ring in the 1992 primaries and his candidacy helped fuel the movement to make government accountable for its fiscal policies  He left an immense and enduring legacy We miss you  Paul  We miss your bravery and your commitment  We miss your friendship and concern  but we know youre resting in peace today after an extraordinary and well lived life    Laura Capps Melissa Wagoner  202  224 2633
