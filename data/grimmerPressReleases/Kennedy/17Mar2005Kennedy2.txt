         FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE        In fact  the Senate confirmed 204 of President Bush s nominees in the last two Congresses  We rejected only 10  because their records  like Mr  Myers  record  were extreme  and failed to show a commitment to upholding basic protections important to the American people     Democrats stand ready to work with the President in confirming qualified nominees who will uphold our rights and liberties  but the Administration will have to meet us half way  Renominating persons who have been rejected before does not signal a willingness to do so     Last year  we voted against Mr  Myers because of his record of hostility to environmental protections  and his failure to respect the rights of Native Americans during his years as Solicitor of Interior  If anything  the reasons to oppose his confirmation to a life time position on a federal court are even stronger now  because of new revelations about his record     It s especially important for a nominee to the Ninth Circuit to be able to impartially review cases affecting issues on environmental law and the rights of Native Americans  The states in that Circuit are home to many Native American tribes and contain vast public lands  The court often has the final word on legal issues affecting the environment and the rights of Native Americans  Mr  Myers  record raises major doubts on these issues    During the two years he served as chief lawyer for the Department of the Interior  he often failed in his duty to ensure that his decisions properly took into account the Department s unique relationship with Native Americans and to consult with Native American tribes on matters affecting them    No case better illustrates the problem than his role in the Glamis Imperial Gold Mine project  In 2001  as Solicitor of Interior  Mr  Myers issued a formal opinion that cleared the way for a foreign company to build a 1 650 acre open pit gold mine in the heart of the California Desert Conservation Area    one of America s most culturally and ecologically sensitive areas    The mine project threatened to devastate a local tribe s ability to practice its religion and culture  The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation concluded that allowing the mine to be built would mean that the tribe s ability to practice their sacred traditions as a living part of their community life and development would be lost     As a result  the Department concluded that the mine would violate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act  which prohibits mining that causes unnecessary or undue degradation of federal lands  But Mr  Myers then issued an opinion reinterpreting the words of the statute in a sway that would have allowed the mine to go forward    A federal court has held that Mr  Myers  opinion misconstrued the clear mandate of the Act  and ignored well established canons of statutory construction    Mr  Myers  obvious mis reading of the law is very troubling  and so is the way he reached his decision  He had an obligation to engage in government to government consultation with the tribe before acting against their interests  but he failed to meet with them or with other Colorado River tribes affected by the mine before making his decision  Instead  he met with representatives of the foreign mining company and  in their words  let them tell their story  But the tribes were not given the same chance for their story to be heard    His action is analogous to a judge hearing oral argument in a case only from the side he agrees with  In fact  it s much worse  because the side that didn t get a hearing was the side Mr  Myers had a duty to consult    Mr  Myers says he knew enough about Native American views to make his decision without speaking to the tribes  because he d read their court filings and a letter from the attorney for the Quechan tribe explaining its concerns  But that letter stated only that the mine threatened areas sacred to the tribe and asked for a meeting with Mr  Myers  which the tribe never got  Six months later  when Mr  Myers finally got around to replying to the letter  he told the tribe he d already issued his decision permitting the mine     It s misleading for Mr  Myers to use the tribe s letter asking for a meeting as a way to justify his decision not to meet with tribal leaders  His other reasons for not meeting with them tribe are equally incredible     In answers to written questions  he used the 9 11 terrorist attack as a reason for not meeting  But two days after September 11th  he met face to face with representatives of the mine     He also stated in answers to written questions that he would have met with the tribes if they had come to Washington  But he never contacted the tribes to tell them that  The Quechan tribe has expressed dismay that Mr  Myers would use this national tragedy to excuse his failure to consult with them  when it never prevented him from meeting with the mining company  Despite many attempts to do so  Mr  Myers refuses to acknowledge that his trust obligation and duty of consultation toward the tribes required that he give them  at the very least  the same hearing he provided the private company    Unfortunately  this is not the only example of Mr  Myers  insensitivity to Native American rights  He also actively supported the efforts of Oil Dri  the world s largest cat litter manufacturer  to build a kitty litter processing facility on federal land near the ancestral burial grounds of the Reno Sparks Indian Colony in Nevada  In that case  the Reno Sparks Indian Colony had asked Mr  Myers  in his role as a trustee for Native American lands  to support the tribe s efforts to oppose permits for the facility  Instead  Mr  Myers urged the Justice Department to file an amicus brief opposing the tribe s interests  Mr  Myers cannot recall a single other instance in which he felt so strongly that he asked the Justice Department to serve as amicus in a case  yet he did so to assist a private company with interests opposed to the tribe     In that case  the government argued that federal law prevented a Nevada county from denying a permit for the kitty litter plant on private lands  an argument later rejected by a Nevada court     As a result of this record  Mr  Myers s nomination has generated wide spread opposition from Native American tribes  That opposition has only grown stronger since we last considered his nomination  He is opposed by the National Congress of American Indians  the oldest and largest national organization of Native American and Alaska Native governments  which has never before opposed a nomination to the federal courts  He s opposed by the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians  which also has never before opposed a judicial nominee  and by many  many other Native American tribes and organizations    The concerns about Mr  Myers  record on Native American issues alone should be enough to reject to his nomination  But his environmental record is just as troubling    As Solicitor of Interior  his decisions on these issues often went hand in hand with the interests of his former clients in the mining and cattle industries  He issued a legal opinion undermining an environmental group s effort to purchase and retire grazing permits on ecologically sensitive public land  After Mr  Myers  first hearing  we learned that as Solicitor  he supported giving millions of dollars  worth of public land to a private company  although readily available public documents showed that the company had no credible claim to the land  He admits that he never sought an estimate of the land s value before seeking to transfer the land to private interests     In addition  a new report by the Inspector General of the Interior Department raises serious questions about Mr  Myers s failure to supervise an Associate Solicitor  whom he personally authorized to negotiate a settlement with a politically connected Wyoming rancher who repeatedly violated grazing regulations over many years  That settlement has been widely criticized  including by the Administrative Law Judge in the case  as giving the rancher a sweetheart deal that excused past grazing violations  granted new permits  and made it harder to cite this rancher than other ranchers for identical conduct  The Administrative Law Judge called the behavior by his office in the case shocking  disturbing and disappointing  Mr  Myers admits that he was briefed several times about the agreement  but he apparently never asked any question about its substance  and failed to supervise the negotiations  He also admits that he never took any disciplinary action against the Associate Solicitor  Bob Comer  who negotiated the deal  even after problems with the settlement became public  At the very least  the incident raises serious questions about his judgment in selecting and supervising the Mr  Comer in this important task    Mr  Myers has also criticized environmental protections  In a speech to the Cattlemen s Association  he stated that  t he biggest disaster now facing ranchers is not nature       but a flood of regulations designed to turn the West into little more than a theme park  He has made numerous other intemperate statements disparaging environmental laws  which he has called outright  top down coercion     Mr  Myers and his supporters dismiss these statements as off hand remarks with little or no meaning  Like every other nominee before this Committee  Mr  Myers says that if confirmed he will put aside past views and look at the issues  We are asked to trust that despite the intensity with which he s advocated these views  and the years he s devoted to opposing environmental regulations that restrain the mining and cattle industries  he will still follow the law if he s confirmed to the Ninth Circuit  Repeating that mantra again and again in the face of his extreme record does not make it credible that he will do so     The hallmark of our system of justice is that all who go to court must know that they will get a fair hearing  Even those who are poor and have no political power or influence have a right to judges who respect that right     Mr  Myers  record does not justify a life time appointment to the court of appeals  He s free to keep advocating for private interests in his law practice  but I doubt we d even confirm him now for the Department of Interior  and we certainly shouldn t confirm him for a federal court
