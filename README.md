# Computational Content Analysis Notebooks

These are a series of Jupyter notebooks from a class on Computational Content Analysis at the university of Chicago.

To use them follow the following steps:

1. Install Python 3 and Jupyter, we recommend using the Anaconda distribution found [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
2. Download the notebooks and data from GitHub
3. Unzip the files and open a terminal in the directory
4. Install the requirements `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`
5. Start the Jupyter Notebook server `jupyter notebook`

The notebooks are:

1. [Intro](1-Intro/1-intro.ipynb)
2. [Corpus Linguistics](2-Corpus-Linguistics/2-Corpus-Linguistics.ipynb)
3. [Clustering and Topic Modeling](3-Clustering-and-Topic-Modeling/3-Clustering-and-Topic-Modeling.ipynb)
4. [Word Embedding](4-Word-Embedding/4-Word-Embedding.ipynb)
5. [Reliability](5-Reliability/5-Reliability.ipynb)
6. [Classification](6-Classification/6-Classification.ipynb)
7. [Information Extraction](7-Information-Extraction/7-Information-Extraction.ipynb)
8. [Semantic Networks](8-Semantic-Networks/8-Semantic-Networks.ipynb)
9. [Beyond Text](9-Beyond-Text/9-Beyond-Text.ipynb)
