      "Content analysis is a research method for studying communication artifacts. Social scientists use content analysis to quantify patterns in communication. Practices and philosophies of content analysis vary between scholarly communities. They all involve systematic reading or observation of texts or artifacts which are assigned labels (sometimes called codes) to indicate the presence of interesting, meaningful patterns [1] [2]. After labeling a large set of texts, a researcher is able to statistically estimate the proportions of patterns in the texts, as well as correlations between patterns. Computers are increasingly used in content analysis. Popular qualitative data analysis programs provide efficient work-flow and data management tools for labeling. Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. Machine learning classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts which can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate.\n",
